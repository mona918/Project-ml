Title:Fashion-MNIST Image Classification using KNN Algorithm 

Objective:
The objective of this project is to classify images from the Fashion-MNIST dataset using the K-Nearest Neighbors 
(KNN) algorithm and to analyze how the value of K affects the accuracy of the model.

Dataset:
In this project, I have used the Fashion-MNIST dataset. 
It consists of grayscale images of size 28x28 pixels. 
The dataset contains different categories of clothing items such as T-shirts, trousers etc.
Each image belongs to one of the 10 classes.

Methodology:
First, the Fashion-MNIST dataset was loaded into Python. The image data was arrenged and normalized 
so that it can be used for training the model.  
Then, the KNN classifier was implemented. Eucledian distance function has been used to measure the data. The model was trained using different values of K (number of neighbors).  
For each value of K, the accuracy of the model was calculated. A graph was plotted between K values and
 accuracy to observe the impact of K on performance.

Results:
The model achieved good accuracy on the test data.  
The best accuracy obtained was approximately 0.9 for an optimal value of K.  
From the graph, it was observed that very small or very large values of K reduce accuracy,
 while a moderate K gives better results.

Conclusion:
KNN is a simple and effective algorithm for image classification when the dataset is not very complex.  
The performance of KNN depends heavily on the choice of K value.  
From this project, I learned how to load datasets, apply KNN, calculate accuracy, 
and analyze results using graphs.
